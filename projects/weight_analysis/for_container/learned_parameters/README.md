This is a directory for storing parameter data (model weights, etc.) to be used when evaluating models.
The initial version contains four numpy files start with 'train' in their names, which are the features and labels for the two model types extracted from the training dataset.
More features can be involved from data in configuration mode. These features will be overwritten if the configuration mode is running multiple times.
