This is a directory for storing parameter data (model weights, etc.) to be used when evaluating models.
The initial directory contains three classifiers that are trained on the training dataset and the numpy files of features and corresponding labels extracted from training dataset.
More classifiers might be involved from data in configuration mode. The container would prioritize the newly built classifiers from the configuration mode.
